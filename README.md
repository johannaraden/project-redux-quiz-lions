# Redux quiz project

For this project the purpose was to create a quiz game using React Redux. The user is able to see one question at a time and also able to choose between multiple answers in order to get to the next question. 

## The problem

After sketching and discussion we had an idea of what it would look like and also what role the reducer would play in the application. Thanks to the reducer we are able to update state for things like the correct answer and which question in the array is showing at the moment. With the store properly updated it is possible to show how far into the game that player are eg. 5/10 questions answered.
